## Audience Persona

-   The reader would probably be a non-technical professional or student that is interested in data science but lacks the background knowledge in advance mathematics or programming required to read academic papers regarding the topic. Professionals would probably be data-adjacent workers such as product managers or marketers. Students would probably be in non-STEM fields such as linguistics or political science who may not have a strong background in STEM, but may need to use statistical modelling techniques when conducting research.
